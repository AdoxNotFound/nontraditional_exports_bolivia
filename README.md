## *Non-traditional bolivian exports analysis*

EVALUACIÓN DE LAS EXPORTACIONES NO TRADICIONALES DE BOLIVIA 1992 - 2022

This research work delves into the non-traditional exports of Bolivia, first giving context of the general situation of Bolivian international trade, where traditional and non-traditional exports are defined, the latter being mainly made up of products derived from agriculture. The non-traditional products exported in each of the nine departments of Bolivia are analyzed. Of all the exports, soybean oil and soybean cake or flour stand out, due to their price and volume over the last three decades, analyzing their main means and outlets, in addition to the countries that buy these products. Finally, an analysis is made through the use of artificial intelligence models, such as neural networks and XGB regressors, in order to predict the future values ​​of these products.

International trade in Bolivia has 3 main categories:
1. Minerals
2. Hydrocarbons
3. Non-traditional exports
With this internal classification made by INE (Statistics National Institute), is understandable that only ores and hydrocarbons are considered traditional exports
